heading: "Howdy, I'm Jake."

I'm a "fuller stack" embedded systems engineer and IoT developer with experience in
front-end, back-end, and edge hardware systems. 

This is Oak St. Electronics, my personal notebook and portfolio.

I break apart this website into two main sections: [Projects](./projects), where you can find information about personal projects that I've worked on, and [Notes](./notes), a blog where you can find lab notes and tutorials and whatever else I find interesting.

Want to get in touch? [Drop me a line](./contact).
