- 2 med. cloves garlic, minced
- 2 T. olive oil
- 3 cans tomato soup
- 3 cups cold water
- 1/4 cup wine vinegar
- 2 cups chopped cucumber
- 1 cup chopped green pepper
- 1/2 cup chopped onion
- Croutons

In small sauce pan, cook garlic in olive oil, combine in lg. bowl with soup, water, and vinegar.
Chill for 4 hrs. Serve in chilled bowls. Pass chilled vegs. and croutons for garnish.

*My version -- use fresh zucchini, even egg plant, fresh tomatoes or/and fresh tomato juice, carrots, celery,
onion, green pepper, use garlic powder if not fresh. Add vinegar. Cook just 'til tender.
Add chili beans (hot style) & or a bit of rice for a delicious cooked soup. Add veg. oil or a bit of margarine.
Good! !
