- 6 c. scalded milk
- 6 c. pumpkin
- Juliene ham, generous portions
- 1/4 t. fresh ground nutmeg
- 1 t. cinnamon
- May be thickened slightly with flour.

My version:

It isn't necessary to scald the milk. Slowly add milk to the pumpkin.
Onion, sauteed, and salt and pepper can be added.
Instant or left over mashed potatoes may be added with additional milk, 
(you can use skim, dry or evaporated milk or even half & half if a richer soup is desired)
small amount of mashed carrots or mashed rutabaga is good with pumpkin.
The instant potatoes thicken nicely, but a couple T. flour may be used.
A dolup of yogurt & parsley is good on top when served.
Chicken stock, curry powder, bay leaf may be used instead of ham & milk & recipe spices.
