- Beef vegetables
- Chicken vegetables
- Turkey vegetables
  
All cream soups -- use either fresh, frozen or left over vegetables.
Broccoli, cauliflower, potato, asparagus, spinach, celery, tomato, green pea and dried green peas,
better known as sweet peas.
To split pea soup or any of the creamed, carrot is a good additional veg.
For company tomato soup, add a bit of orange juice & a dolup of whipped or sour cream or yogurt.
Add onion & celery to potato soup. To left over or instant potatoes add a can or two of Campbell's 
Cream of Celery soup. For extra special dried lima or white bean soups add tomatoes or tomato sauce, and onions.

Nine bean soup & minestrone are great favorites. Barley is a fine addition to vegetable soups.
Left over beef, even steak & bones may be simmered for stock.

Make chicken stock from wings, backs, etc. of chicken.
Boil & then simmer several hours the frame or carcass of a turkey with onions & celery, strain well.
Discard the carcass, bones etc. & use the clear strained liquid as stock for delicious turkey vegetable 
or plain turkey/noodle soup or a dish of noodles seasoned with the turkey broth.
do not use the turkey or chicken meat left on bones after boiling & simmering.
The flavor is too "flat". If meat is wanted, add some nice slices diced when ready to serve.
Soups or chili can be made from most left overs.
Veg. soup can be made from ground beef.
