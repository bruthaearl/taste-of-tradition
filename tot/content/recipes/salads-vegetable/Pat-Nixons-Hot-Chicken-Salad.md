- 4 c. cooked cold chicken
- 2 T. lemon juice
- 3/4 c. mayonnaise
- 1/2 t. accent
- 1 t. salt
- 2 pimentos cut fine
- 2 c. chopped celery
- 1 t. minced onion
- 4 hard cooked eggs sliced
- 3/4 c. cream of chicken soup undiluted

Combine the above ingredients. Place in casserole.

Top with:
- 1 c. grated cheese
- 1 1/2 c. crushed potato chips
- 2/3 c. chopped almonds
  
Place the casserole in refrigerator over night.
Bake at 400 for 20-25 minutes. Serves 8.

To avoid the "flat" reheated chicken flavor, I prefer freshly cooked chicken or turkey
(never reheated) in any casserole or recipe.
