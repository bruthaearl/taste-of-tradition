In a,king Dutch potato salad, I don't cook the onions, or saute them as most recipes specify,
nor do I use flour to thicken.

Boil until tender but not too soft, the potatoes, add the onions (and celery and green pepper if desired).
Use at least 1/2 or more pounds of good bacon per 5 lbs. potatoes.
Heat the vinegar, add sugar, simmer and pour over the potatoes and vegetables.
Taste and use sugar and vinegar in amounts to your liking.
Not too sweet, not too sour.
Use salt and pepper and additional celery seed if not enough celery flavor.
Add 3 to 5 hard cooked diced eggs and crumbled bacon.
Save some eggs and bacon for topping. Sprinkle with paprika.

Use this same method for a good spinach or green salad, even leaf lettuce.
Taste is the best guide. Paprika is colorful on deviled eggs.

Sweet pickle relish or pickle juice is tasty in mayonnaise type potato salad,
also a spoon or two of good mustard added gives the salad a little "zing".
