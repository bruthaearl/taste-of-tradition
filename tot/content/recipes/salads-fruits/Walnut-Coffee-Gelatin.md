> A great favorite served in a famous Cincinnati cafeteria in years past. Cafeteria closed about 10 years ago.

- 2 pkgs. Knox gelatin
- 2 c. hot coffee
- 1/4 c. sugar
- 2 c. English walnuts
- 2 c. cold water

Sprinkle gelatin over 2 c. cold water . Place over medium heat.
Stir and dissolve about 3 minutes. Add sugar, stir 'til dissolved.
Add 2 cups hot coffee. Let set. Add nuts. 
Serve with a good homemade cream vanilla sauce or whipped cream. Delicious!

*We prefer a rich creamy white vanilla sauce instead of the whipped cream on this luscious coffee gelatin salad.
Use the white sauce on apple dumplings, cobblers or bread pudding.
This is delicious! You will love it!
