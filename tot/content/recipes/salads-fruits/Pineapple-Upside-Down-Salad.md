1) Drain syrup from a 1 lb. 4 oz. can of pineapple slices.
    Add enough water to make 1 1/2 c. liquid. Bring to a boil. 
    Stir in 1 pkg. (3 oz.) orange jello. Cool until almost syrupy.
2) Arrange pineapple slices with cherries in pineapple centers in an 8" cake pan.
    Pour on half the gelatin (set aside the ret and keep at room temp).
    Chill the first layer until set.
3) Combine remaining jello with 1 c. cottage cheese drained well.
    Pour over the first layer. Chill the entire salad until set.
4) To unmold, dip pan in warm water, cover with plate.
    Invert and shake firmly. Try it. Fun to make. Delicious to serve.
