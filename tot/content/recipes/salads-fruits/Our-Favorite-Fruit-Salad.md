This recipe was introduced to our family by Birddie Noe Tavlin,
our grandmother, Fannie Noe Graf's sister.
She was a my great aunt. It was an instant hit at the first serving in the 1920's,
and is still the all time favorite.
In fact, it is the only salad ever served on the holidays by some of my father's relatives.

Use only four fruits, oranges, bananas, canned pineapple, diced and drained red grapes.

- Thicken the pineapple juice (2 c.) with corn starch or flour, about 3 T.
- 1/2 c. sugar (or more)
- 2 eggs

Combine flour and sugar well, slowly add eggs and juice.
Cook until thick. Fold in real whipped cream. Top with large English walnuts.
Serve on lettuce if desired.
